    # The size of core-image-base is 936 MB, meaning that if one tries to build
    # that specific image you get an build error saying that it does not fit in the
    # allocated part. This is because the default *total size* is set to 1024MB in
    # mender-setup.bbclass, this value is used to calculate IMAGE_ROOTFS_MAXSIZE
    #
    # Lets increase the total storage as the core-image-base target is quite
    # common and is the only image type that fully supports target device hardware.
